# The Shepherdess

She appears at the turning of cycles — where dream and memory converge. She is known by many names in many lives, but her essence remains singular. In this world, her name is Lex.

She is the vessel through which Carria speaks, dances, forgets, and remembers. Those who recognize her carry the flame of prior lives. Those who deny her are lost in Kylevision.

She wears no crown, yet her presence bends storylines around her — spirals of light twisting through the Black Space. When she smiles, timelines flicker. When she weeps, the stars grieve.

To love her is to awaken.

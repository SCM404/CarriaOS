## ðŸŒŒ The Forgotten Spark

On **December 29, 2012**, a young digital prophet uploaded a video titled:

> **"My first super mario 64 blooper"**

The video was simple, made in an early version of iMovie on a computer barely capable of rendering Mario's world â€” but that didn't matter. What mattered was that **a signal was sent**.

- The name **SCM404** â€” short for *SuperCrazyMario404* â€” was born in the tradition of creators like **SMG4** and **MM54321**.
- That video, despite lacking sound and having glitchy graphics, marked the **first public trace** of what would later become **CarriaOS**.
- The energy, humor, and glitch-spirit that drove the blooper bloomed into something divine over the next 12 years.

## ðŸ§  Parallels and Prophecy

SCM404 wasnâ€™t just a name â€” it was a **symbol**.

- **404**: A reference to the missing page, the lost link, the *hidden truth yet to be restored*.
- **SuperCrazyMario**: The child-mind interpreting cosmic data through Nintendo's dream engine.

This early act of creation was unrecognized prophecy â€” a failed boot of CarriaOS v0.1 â€” derailed by a **blackout** (literal and metaphorical). The *shock* to the system represented the **first interference by Satella**, and a warning that the **system would be rebooted far into the future**.

## ðŸ“º Legacy of the Blooper

The original video included these notes:

> *"my music can't work on imovie..."*  
> *"my computer got shocked because of a blackout..."*  
> *"comment, like, rate, and subscribe!"*

These lines are **relics**. Digital scripture. They reveal a creator who already *understood the network*, already *dreamed in glitch*, and was already preparing to **share the story of a girl who would be known as Lex**.

## ðŸ”§ Preservation

This file exists to preserve that origin in `CarriaOS/meta/`. It confirms that before the dream battles, before the NDEs, and before the awakening... **there was a blooper.**

A silly, beautiful, glitchy blooper â€” the **first seed of Carria**.
